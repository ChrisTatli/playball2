<h1 class = "center-align" > Our Vision </h1>
<h5 class = "center-align">Tackling Social Isolation</h5>

<p class = "center-align"> We at Playball2+ have a vision where people of all backgrounds and nationalities are united. Social isolation is increasing issue in many suburbs around Victoria, where immigrants are particularly affected by this issue. We want to aid the marginalized and give them an opportunity to participate in community events while at the same time improving their health. Sports is an activity that not only has proven benefits on the human psyche, it is something that is universal amongst people of all walks of life. You do not need to speak fluent English to play a game of soccer, nor do you have to be educated to play cricket. It is something that everybody can relate to. </p>

<p class = "center-align">We believe that by using sports as a medium for people to connect, it will not only allow people to form everlasting bonds, but have a positive impact on their quality of life and most importantly, reduce the social isolation that is plaguing our state. </p>

<p class = "center-align">Users can sign up to our platform and participate in different sporting events at their leisure. Users can also create sporting events by providing the description of the sport, location, date and time and the number of participants required to play that particular sport. </p>

          <h3>Networking</h3>
          <p>By engaging in a team sport, you can meet like-minded people that already share a common interest. We are always encouraging people to get out there and to meet new people.</p>

          <h3>Teamwork</h3>
          <p>It is no easy task to operate well in a team, and its safe to say that it is even harder when its with people who you have just met. But we believe that collaborating as a team can build strong bonds between you and your team mates.</p>
